        The Environmental and Economic Impacts of the COVID-19 by <i> Kelly De Bruin</i>, <i>Eoin Monaghan</i> and <i>Aykut Mert Yaku</i> clearly shows the impact that covid had on the Irish Ecnomy

        In the case of Ireland, the decline in employment figures reached approximately 320,000 as of the 27th of March, and it is expected to exceed 650,000 which corresponds to 28% of the total employment (CBoI, 2020). In order to alleviate the negative consequences of the economic slowdown triggered by the virus crisis, the Irish government announced an economic package consisting of weekly payments of C410 (C350) to those employees (self-employed) who lost their jobs (closed down their businesses). The cost of the crisis on the Irish exchequer, including the loss in wage income tax revenue, is expected to vary between C4 and C4.9 billion based on the level of the decline in employment (Beirne et al., 2020, Table 1). The authors also find that for every 100,000 jobs lost in Ireland, the government will face an increase in welfare spending by around C800 million per quarter. The Central Bank of Ireland projects that the general government balance-to-GDP ratio will be -6%, which was expected to be 0.4% for the year 2020. Similarly, the debt stock-to-GDP ratio will increase from its expected level of 58% to 66% (a 13.8% increase). The Bank expects that the impact of the business interruption on real GDP will be an 8.3% decline, which is mainly sourced from declining private consumption expenditures (9%) and investment expenditures (24.3%). The latter is partially offset by an increase in government expenditures (7.5%) (CBoI, 2020). Fernandes (2020) derives similarly negative figures for Ireland. In the mildest scenario – comprising a return to normality around the end of May – the percentage change of GDP in Ireland is estimated at -4.8%, while in the most stringent scenario, whereby total lockdown remains in place until the end of July, the corresponding value is -10.8% for Ireland
